                    <p>
                        According to the <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/8/9/9/a/6/VL53L0X_DS.pdf"
                            target="_blank">datasheet</a>, the TOF sensor's I2C address is 0x52.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since two TOF sensors will be used, the address of one TOF
                        sensor will be changed with software. The TOF's I2C address can be changed with the
                        setI2CAddress function in the SparkFun_VL53L1X library. Another approach to use two TOF sensors
                        is using the XSHUT pins to toggle on/off each of the TOF sensors. However, this approach
                        means additional overhead due to the need to set the GPIO outputs
                        and continuously toggle the sensor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the car, the TOF sensors will be placed on the front and right side. In this configuration,
                        obstacles to the left and behind will be missed. If a task involves moving backwards, the right
                        TOF sensor may need to be repositioned to the back.

                                    The TOF sensor has two operating modes available through the SparkFun_VL53L1X
                                    library:
                                    short and long. According to the <a

                                        target="_blank">datasheet</a>, the short distance mode is able to detect
                                    the furthest distance under strong ambient light. While the long distance mode has
                                    the
                                    greatest range in the dark, the operation of the robot is unlikely to take
                                    place in dark environments. Thus, the short distance mode was selected for the TOF
                                    sensor.

                                    measurements
                                    are taken and sent over BLE to a laptop. The laptop then calculates the mean, and
                                    standard deviation, of the measurements. The data is also labeled with timestamps.
                                    By
                                    finding the mean difference between timestamps, the ranging time is determined.

                                    The timing budget can be explicitly set with the function <i>setTimingBudget</i>. To
                                    see how different ranging time effects accuracy and repeatbility, 100 samples are
                                    taken at an actual distance of 50 cm. Intuitively, a higher ranging time lead to
                                    more accurate measurements and smaller standard deviation.

                            To use two TOF sensors simultaneously, the active-low XSHUT pin of TOF sensor 2 is tied to
                            GND,
                            the address of the TOF sensor 1 is modified, and the XSHUT pin is set high to restart TOF
                            sensor
                            2. The code below shows the setup of the two TOF sensors.

                        <p>
                            To characterize the speed of the TOF sensors, the Artemis clock is printed. If the distance
                            sensor data is ready, the distance measurement is printed. The code below illustrates this
                            implementation.
                        </p>
                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/seanzhangw/fbc07deab9dcc0ea16e4bb533fcd5475.js"></script>
                        <p>
                            A screenshot of the serial monitor is shown below. There is a 93 ms delay between TOF sensor
                            1
                            distance measurements. This delay is consistent with TOF sensor 2 and other distance
                            measurements. The loop executes every 4 ms, and a blocking TOF sensor read would be the
                            limiting
                            factor. To mitigate this, the TOF sensor read is done in a non-blocking manner.
