                        Pins <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> are used to control the two motor drivers.
                        The wiring diagram of the motor drivers is shown below. The Artemis Nano and Apollo3 pinout
                        schematics were consulted to find pins capable of PWM outputs. The A and B input and output
                        channels are coupled together to drive one motor to increase the total current output. The TOF
                        and IMU sensors are excluded.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Artemis is powered by a dedicated 650 mAh battery while the motor drivers are powered from a
                        850 mAh battery. Since the current draw of the motor drivers is high, having a dedicated power
                        supply for the Artemis ensures that the Artemis does not reset due to voltage drops. To reduce
                        EMI interference, wire lengths are kept short.

                        <p>Before permanently assembling electronics into the car chassis, the dual motor drivers are
                            each tested to ensure they can provide PWM output. A DC power supply is used to power a
                            motor driver and the output is checked with an oscillopscoe for this initial test. The OUT1
                            and OUT2 pins are conected to the oscillopscoe probes.</p>
                        <h4>Power supply discussion</h4>
                        <p>The DC power supply was set to 3.7V. Although the drivers accept up to 10.8V (<a
                                href="https://www.pololu.com/product-info-merged/2130">datasheet</a>), 3.7V is chosen to
                            simulate the voltage of the 850 mAh battery.</p>

                        <p> The setup is shown below. In the figure, the motor driver is being controlled from pins 15
                            and 16 on the Artemis and the OUT2 pin is being scoped. </p>

                            <p>With the motor drivers tested, the electronics can be assembled into the car chassis. The
                                TOF sensors are mounted at the front and back of the car. The 850 mAh battery is stored
                                in the battery compartment. The Artemis board, 650 mAh, and IMU are in the compartment

                                physically secure the electronics. Zip ties may be added in the future to further secure

                            <h4> Lower limit PWM discussion</h4>
                            <p></p>
                            <p> The lower limit PWM is the minimum PWM duty cycle that causes the car to move. The lower
                                limit
                                PWM is found by slowly incrementing the PWM value until the car moves. This value was
                                found to be around an <i>analogWrite</i> of around 40, or a 16% PWM duty cycle. However,
                                testing was conducted with a battery that had been previously used for testing. With a
                                freshly charged battery, an <i>analogWrite</i> of 45, or a 17.6% PWM duty cycle was able
                                to start the car from rest. </p>
                            <p> An in-place turn required an <i>analogWrite</i> of 60, corresponding to a 23.5% PWM duty
                                cycle. </p>
                            <h4>Calibration Factor</h4>
                            <p>
                                Initially, the <i>analogWrite</i> values for both motors were set to the same value. The
                                result of this test is shown below. The car veers to the right. This could be due to the
                                car being
                                unbalanced or the motors having different characteristics. To correct this, the left
                                motor is set to a lower <i>analogWrite</i> value. The car now moves straight. The
                                calibration factor is the ratio of the left motor <i>analogWrite</i> value to the right
                                motor <i>analogWrite</i> value in order for the car to go straight. The calibration
                                factor was found to be 0.9.
                            </p>

                                    The <i>control.ino</i> file is shown below with implementations for each of the new
                                    commands. Currently, the values will be set by the incoming bluetooth command. The
                                    <i>LEFT_A</i>, <i>LEFT_B</i>, <i>RIGHT_A</i>, <i>RIGHT_B</i>, <i>time_ms</i>, and
                                    <i>CALIBRATION_FACTOR</i> are macros defined in the <i>control.h</i> file. They are
                                    13, 14, 15, 16, 750, and 0.9 respectively

                                <p> Turns are implemented by setting the left or right motor driver to a much larger
                                    value than the other driver. Through experimentation, suitable values for a left and
                                    right turn were found.</p>

                                <p>Much of this lab involved soldering and assembling hardware. Thus, much of the
                                    success and reliability of the end product relied on the quality of the assembly.
                                    The main challenge faced was achieivng reliable outputs from the motor driver. Loose
                                    wire connections and poor solder joints meant my connections would be unreliable.
