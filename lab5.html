                    <p>
                        An effective debugging system is helpful for tuning and implementing a closed-loop controller.
                        The debug interface used is a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connection. Data is sent from the
                        Artemis to a Jupyter Lab instance where data is processed and visualized.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sending data over BLE during a control loop is computationally expensive. To increase the
                        frequency of the control loop, data is stored in a buffer and sent over BLE after a control task
                        is finished. The buffer is then cleared and the process repeats.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Below is the definition of the <i>ControlDataPacket</i> and the associated
                        <i>ControlDataBuffer</i>. The packet contains all relevant data
                        seen by the controller.

                    <p>This packet is populated by a <i>logControlData(...)</i> function. This function is called during
                        each control loop and populated with the most recent data. </p>

                        <p>A PI controller is chosen for its ability to quickly converge to a solution with an
                            effective proportional gain term while reducing
                            the amount of steady-state error with an effective integral gain term.</p>
                        <p>The control loop for the PI controller is shown below. The variables </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><i>MAX_SPEED</i></li>
                            <li><i>P_GAIN</i></li>
                            <li><i>I_GAIN</i></li>
                            <li><i>delay_time</i></li>
                            <li><i>target_tof</i></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p> are configurable at run-time via BLE to assist in tuning and debugging. The output of the
                            controller, <i>speed</i>, is clamped to the value set in <i>MAX_SPEED</i>. This is to
                            prevent the car from moving too fast and overshooting the target distance. Furthermore, to
                            prevent wind-up error where the integral term causes overshooting behavior, an error term of
                            less than 20 sets the accumulated error to 0 to signal that a solution is reached. The
                            <i>lastDirection</i> variable is an enum that holds the last direction the car traveled.
                            Because of the car's high deadband, the car struggles to change direction or start from
                            rest. To mitigate this, the car is given a small forward or backward motion if
                            <i>lastDirection</i> is not consistent with the intended direction of movement.
                        </p>
                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/seanzhangw/c3e88cee8921a5421bcdc4d4c78a8356.js"></script>

                        <h4 class="mb-1">Range/Sampling time discussion</h4>
                        <p>
                            A quick execution time of the control loop is essential for a responsive controller. With
                            the default parameters of the TOF sensors in SHORT mode, control loop executions occur every
                            ~90 ms. This is very slow and causes large accumulations in the integral error.
                        </p>
                        <p>To decrease the sampling time of the TOF sensors, the function <i>setTimingBudget</i> is
                            used. While decreasing the timing budget to 20 ms increases the variance of the TOF readings
                            (shown
                            with quantative data in lab 3), the control loop execution time decreases to ~15 ms. The
                            tradeoff of higher variance for a quicker control loop is worth it because the faster loop
                            means the car makes more dynamic adjustments depending on its current position. With the
                            increased samples of the TOF sensor, the reading mean is still a very close approximation to
                            the true distance. </p>

                        <p>The SHORT ranging mode is used due to the increased sensitivity of the controller as the car
                            nears the setpoint. When the car is far away, the speed is clamped anyway by the
                            <i>MAX_SPEED</i> variable, making accurate long range measurements unnecessary.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Kp/Ki Justification</h4>
                        <p> The controller is tuned to
                            a <i>P_GAIN</i> of 0.1 and an <i>I_GAIN</i> of 0.00001, and a <i>target_tof</i> setpoint of
                            300 (mm). During tuning, <i>P_GAIN</i> values
                            with smaller orders of magnitude significantly increased the amount of time needed to be
                            within 1-foot of a
                            wall. Larger orders of magnitude meant the car would overshoot the setpoint and send the car
                            into the wall. Smaller <i>I_GAIN</i> values meant the car would not converge to the converge
                            to the correct steady state solution due to the speed adjustments being too small to
                            overcome the motor's deadband. Larger <i>I_GAIN</i> values meant the car would overshoot the
                            setpoint when released from a distance far away from the setpoint. The time taken to reach
                            the setpoint meant the integral term would dominate.

                        <h4>Implementation</h4>
                        <p>To further increase the frequency at which the control loop runs, linear interpolation is
                            used to calcualte the car's position even when a TOF reading is not available. Two possible
                            approaches are considered:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Linearly interpolate between the last two TOF position readings.</li>
                            <li>Linearly interpolate between the last two positions (can be calculated or TOF
                                positions).</li>
                        </ol>
                        In the second approach, errors in the TOF readings and in the linear interpolation calculations
                        accumulated, eventually leading to erroneous values for the car's position. The first approach
                        bases calculations on the TOF readings, which are more accurate than the calculated positions.
                        The first approach is also not suseptible to the drift seen in the second approach. The
                        implementation of the first approach is shown below.
                        </p>
                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/seanzhangw/19e644eddf1e6d49a327d72030966f5c.js"></script>
                        <p> The function <i>nonBlockReadTOF1(&distance1)</i> returns 0 on a successful read, and 1
                            otherwise. For an unsuccessful read, the linear interpolation is done by using the last two
                            successful readings. For a succesful read, the reading is stored in the <i>distance1</i>
                            reference. Furthermore, the reading is stored into <i>last_tof</i> and <i>last_last_tof</i>,
                            <i>time_between_tof</i>, and <i>last_tof_time</i> are adjusted to hold the new TOF reading,
                            the last TOF reading, the time between the current TOF measurement and the last tof
                            measurement, and the current TOF measurement respectively.
                            Notably, a cast to the long data type is needed to prevent integer overflow during the
                            calculation of the distance moved according to the last two tof readings.

                                effectively doubles the frequency of the control loop if the loop is previously limited
                                by the TOF sensor's sampling rate.

                                With the same <i>P_GAIN</i>, <i>I_GAIN</i>, and <i>target_tof</i> values, the increased
                                control loop frequency meant the speed of the <i>MAX_SPEED</i> of the car can be
                                increased to 80. This is because the car can make more dynamic adjustments to its speed
                                as it approaches the setpoint.

                                speed, distance from the setpoint, and the integral error are shown below. Notably, the
                                variance in the TOF readings still causes some issues for the linear interpolation
                                calculations. However, the mean values are accurate enough to still be an effective
                                controller.
