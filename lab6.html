                    <p>
                        An effective debugging system is helpful for tuning and implementing a closed-loop controller.
                        The debug interface used is a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connection. Data is sent from the
                        Artemis to a Jupyter Lab instance where data is processed and visualized.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sending data over BLE during a control loop is computationally expensive. To increase the
                        frequency of the control loop, data is stored in a buffer and sent over BLE after a control task
                        is finished. The buffer is then cleared and the process repeats.
                    </p>

                        Below is the definition of the <i>YawControlPacket</i> and the associated
                        <i>YawControlDataBuffer</i>. The packet contains all relevant data
                        seen by the controller.

                    <p>This packet is populated by a <i>record_yaw_pid_data(...)</i> function. This function is called
                        during
                        each control loop and populated with the most recent data. </p>

                    <p>After a control task is done executing, the <i>sendControlData(...)</i> function then writes the
                        data in the <i>ControlDataBuffer</i> over the BLE connection.</p>

                    <p>
                        In Jupyter Lab, a Python function reads and parses the sent strings. The data is parsed into
                        Python arrays.

                    <p>
                        The data can then be plotted with Python libraries to easily visualize the data for debugging.

                        <p>
                            The integral of the gyroscope reading is used to calculate the car's orientation. The
                            gyroscope measures the rate of rotation, and by integrating this rate over time, the
                            orientation angle can be determined. For roll and pitch, the accelerometer readings can be
                            fused with gyroscope measurements with a complementary filter to mitigate drift and lower
                            noise. However, the yaw angle cannot be calculated with the accelerometer due to gravity
                            being parallel to the yaw axis. To minimize yaw drift, the digital motion processor (DMP) is
                            used. The DMP is setup according to this <a
                                href="https://fastrobotscornell.github.io/FastRobots-2025/tutorials/dmp.html">guide</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To prevent the DMP FIFO buffer from overflowing, data from the DMP is read with the
                            <i>readDMPYaw()</i> function every time the <i>loop()</i> function is executed. The
                            <i>readDMPYaw()</i> function calcualtes the yaw from the quarternion components output from
                            the DMP. <i>readDMPYaw()</i>
                            function calcualtes the yaw from the quarternion component data from the DMP. The yaw is
                            then stored in a global variable.

                            the gyroscope can measure +/- 250 dps, +/- 500 dps, +/- 1000 dps, and +/- 2000 dps depending
                            on the programmable <i>GYRO_FS_SEL</i> register configuration. These specifications are
                            enough for our

                        <p>
                            To make tuning the controller easier, parameters such as <i>P_GAIN</i>, <i>D_GAIN</i> and
                            <i>target_yaw</i> are configurable at runtime. The controller executes within the
                            <i>loop()</i> function, allowing for bluetooth commands to be processed while the controller
                            is running. This means the setpoint, gains and other parameters can be adjusted without
                            stopping the controller.
                        </p>
                        <p> To start and stop the controller, the <i>YAW_CONTROL</i> command takes in an argument that
                            acts as a flag for starting the controller. Similarly, the <i>RECORD_PID_DATA</i> signals
                            the controller to log data with the <i>record_yaw_pid_data(..)</i>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The control interface is modified to include <i>turnLeft(..)</i> and <i>turnRight(..)</i>
                            functions. Corresponding BLE commands are added to allow for the car to turn left or right
                            to tune the speed offsets to allow the car to perform tight turns.

                    <div>
                        <p>One issue is determining whether to turn left or right based on whether the target angle is
                            closer by going clockwise or counterclockwise. This requires calculating the shortest
                            angular distance between the current orientation and the target orientation. This
                            determination is made with the following algorithm: </p>
                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/seanzhangw/1557320f2bc671c0b78a1053b3a7b71b.js"></script>

                        <p>
                            The step function for the P controller is shown below. The shortet angular distance is
                            calculated using the algorithm above, and the error is scaled by the <i>P_GAIN</i> term.
                            Depending on if the shortest path is in the clockwise or counter-clockwise direction, the
                            car is turned left or right.
                        </p>

                            values lead to additional overshooting.

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            To reduce the overshooting and oscillations seen in the P controller, a PD controller is
                            implemented. The PD controller uses the derivative of the error to act as a dampening term
                            as
                            the car approaches the setpoint. The derivative term is calculated by taking the difference
                            between the current error and the previous error and dividing by the time elapsed between
                            the two errors.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Taking the derivative of the change in yaw (which is the same as the change in error) is the
                            same as the gyroscope output since the gyroscope output is integrated to find yaw. However,
                            for ease of implementation, the derivative term is calculated directly using the DMP yaw.
                            This
                            extra calculation did not result in a noticeable difference in the controller's speed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Taking the difference between only two error measurements can be noisy. Furthermore,
                            changing setpoints can cause derivative kick as the change in error has a large
                            instantaneous change. To reduce noise and the effect of derivative kick, the
                            derivative term is passed through a low-pass filter. The three additional lines needed
                            within the control loop are shown below. Instead of directly keeping track of the time
                            between control loop executions, the average time between control loop executions is used.
                            Line 3 is the low pass filter with configurable alpha to adjust the degree of filtering.

                            interfered with. The <i>P_GAIN</i> was set to 8 and the <i>D_GAIN</i> was set to 0.5. Lower
                            <i>D_GAIN</i> values lead to overshooting, while higher values lead to a slower response.

                            The graphs below show the car's speed, proportional error, derivative error, and yaw over
                            time at a setpoint of 90 degrees. With the derivative term added, there is noticeable
                            reduced overshooting.

                    <h4 class="mb-1">Considering an Integral Term</h4>
                    <p>
                        The integral term was deemed unnecessary for the controller. The integral term is useful when
                        the car fails to reach the setpoint. However, the car's consistently reaches the setpoint within
                        reasonable time.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="mb-1">Range/Sampling time discussion</h4>
                    <p>
                        A quick execution time of the control loop is essential for a responsive controller.
                        While the exeuction time was limited by the TOF sensor in lab 5, the DMP outputs at rates up to
                        55 Hz. The control loop is only limited by its own computation time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To characterize the control loop's exeuction time and frequency, the time between control loop
                        executions is passed as part of the <i>YawControlPacket</i> data. The mean of this data is the
                        average time between control loop executions, the control loop's frequency can be calculated.
                    </p>
